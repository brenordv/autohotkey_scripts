# Autohotkey Scripts
This is a repository of AHK scripts that i've made to share some scripts i find useful.

```
Important note: This is not a product, i may take a long time to answer questions. 
In any way, feel free to fork this repo and change it the way you see fit.
```

# How to use
Install the **current version** from the oficial site: https://www.autohotkey.com/
The (starting) version I use here is **1.1.32.00**. Consider it as the minimum required version.

Unless noted otherwise, all scripts here are 'one-shot', meaning that they will do whatever they do and then they will **exit**.

Have fun.


- ```ms_teams__toggle_mute.ahk```: Will change the focus to Microsoft Teams window, use the toogle-mute shortcut (Ctrl+Shit+M) and then change the focus back to the window you were using. (Won't work across Windows Desktops. Ie: You're using something in Desktop 1 and Ms Teams is in Desktop 2)
